Q: Why does wicked not request DHCPv6 IP address on my card?
A: Wicked follows the network administrator configuration provided
   by the router in its advertisements (IPv6 RA) by default and
   starts DHCPv6 request if the Managed or OtherConfig flags in the
   RA forwarded to it by the kernel is enabled.
   When there is no IPv6 router on the network, the router sends an
   IPv6 RA with DHCPv6 disabled, the firewall blocks icmpv6 traffic
   or the network card is incorrectly reporting carrier detection,
   wicked-dhcp6 may stay silent waiting for RA events.
   Set FW_BOOT_FULL_INIT="yes" in /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2,
   so the SuSEfirewall2_init.service does not block icmpv6 packets.
   To provide/override the RA flags, set the DHCLIENT6_MODE=managed
   either in the ifcfg(5) file or in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp.
   See also ifcfg-dhcp(5) manual page.

Q: My network is not IPv6 enabled, how to use DHCPv4 only?
A: Change the ifcfg(5) config file to use BOOTPROTO=dhcp4 instead of
   BOOTPROTO=dhcp. To disable IPv6 completely, you can use either
   sysctl.conf(5) config file:
     net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
     net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
   or the ipv6.disable=1 kernel boot parameter, e.g. in the
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX variables of /etc/default/grub.

Q: Why is wicked not setting IP address on my network card?
A: The network card probably does not have carrier.
   Wicked monitors events and states and preforms the setup steps
   according to state and layering of network device.
   Once the carrier is detected (and e.g. wireless link
   authentication was successful), it will start verifying the IP
   addresses for duplicates and applying them.
   To break the rules and apply the IP address before the carrier
   is detected and layer 2 setup finished, you can disable it per
   interface using LINK_REQUIRED=no in the ifcfg config file.
   See also ifcfg(5) manual page.

Q: Why wicked does not set my (default) static route?
A: Each route using a gateway needs a direct route covering the
   gateway. When there is a static IP address (IPADDR) defined
   and it is in the same network as the gateway, the IP address
   causes to prepend the direct route matching also the gateway.
   Otherwise declare such route explicitely, for example, when
   there is an IPADDR="192.168.1.2/24" (192.168.1 net), but the
   router has the IP 192.168.0.1 (in 192.168.0 net), define an
   explicit direct route for the gateway first:
      192.168.0.1  -           - eth0
      default      192.168.0.1 - eth0
